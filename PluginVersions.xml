    <ExtraInformation>
        This version will apply a schema fix to MySQL LIMS databases which may take anywhere between a minute and an hour to perform.
        The amount of time depends on the number of traces stored in the database.  If your database has over 30,000 traces
        then it is recommended that an administrator perform it beforehand. Contact support@mooreasoftware.org for instructions.
