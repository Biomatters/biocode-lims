''Numerous other fixes and usability improvements''


==Biocode Plugin 2.1 - 13 May 2011==
'''Interoperability''' We have improved the ability for LIMS users to collaborate.  If you are a medium sized lab with no existing field management system, you can upload your specimen data to Google Fusion Tables, and access your data directly in the plugin.  If you have an existing system based on MySql, then you can connect the plugin directly to your database.  We have also added the ability to save sequence and assembly binning parameters as profiles in Genieous, and share them with your colleagues.

'''Workflow Streamlining''' We've made a lot of small tweaks to the assembly workflow to make it easier (and faster) to bulk process sequences.  You can assemble to a curated reference sequence database (which removes the need to trim before the assembly step, and the need to verify taxonomy after), and the addition of the "number of ambiguities in consensus" binning parameter makes processing assembly binning much faster (Geneious makes obvious calls on disagreements itself, and leaves just the ambiguous ones up to the technician).

===Detailed list of changes:===

* Added a connection manager - save and choose multiple accounts, connect automatically on startup
* Added support for FIMS databases stored in Google Fusion Tables
* Added support for FIMS databases stored in MySQL
* Summary table views of workflows now contain taxonomy fields - right click on the table headers to choose them
* Added a tabular view for plates - select a plate and click "Tabular plate view"
* You are now required to specify a locus when creating workflows
* Added a button to export primers in the LIMS to your local database - edit a reaction on a plate to see it
* Added the ability to zoom in plate views
* You can now mark as pass/failed in LIMS from consensus alignments - select the sequences you want to mark within the alignment
* Added a new "Run" reaction state to PCR and sequencing reactions
* New sample loci for reactions
* It is now easier to change the locus of existing plates using the bulk editor
* Added a 'mark as submitted' action to sequences
